# neovim-init-file

This is Blaine's neovim init.vim file.
It is current as of September 5, 2021.
It is being used with neovim version 0.6.
It calls some plugins that depend on Lua, so these plugins need to be commented out if using an older version of neovim.
It has been customized to enable the editing of LaTeX files and code files from about a dozen programming languages.
